# OpenGL Space Shooter Game

## About the Project
This is a Space Shooter Game programmed in C++ using OpenGL and GLFW libraries. The goal is to take out the spaceships without taking damage. Each hit removes one heart from your life pool. 

## Controls

The enemy spaceship pattern can be changed with the UP and DOWN keys. The spaceship controls are WASD and UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Press SPACE to attack.

## Photoshop tutorial

I added a Photoshop tutorial where I design the [spaceships and other game assets](https://youtu.be/WE-DJ-A5yTY). I also added a tutorial that demonstrates how to [configure your projects in Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/ZFx30Zmo1yI).
