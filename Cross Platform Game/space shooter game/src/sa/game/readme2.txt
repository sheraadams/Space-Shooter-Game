## About
This game was inspired by LearnOpenGL's Breakout game. The game mechanics and physics are different. I added parallax scrolling and the inverted rendering is used here but the x and y axis remain and parallax scrolling continues. This is a pvp style game where you charm-attack the second player with hearts. 
The hearts attack code is here as well as the code to make the second player fly. There is also code to make a horizontally scrolling object fly across the x axis.
